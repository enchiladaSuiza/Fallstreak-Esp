    narrator2 "Once upon a time, there was a world that had lost all but one to time."
    narrator2 "A lone girl who did not know the warmth of others, yet longed for it still."
    narrator2 "One day, she beheld her reflection in the water and had a thought:"
    narrator2 "\"If the person on the other side were to come over here…\""
    narrator2 "\"I would no longer be alone.\""
    narrator2 "It was a simple and childish wish."
    narrator2 "Yet the girl poured her everything into that wish."

    narrator2 "The girl created many ‘selves’ as time tick-tocked away."
    narrator2 "One made of wood. One made of clay.{p=1}One made of porcelain, and one made of plastic.{p=1}She crafted those ‘selves’ without end."

    narrator2 "Upon seeing its eyes open for the first time, the girl voiced the first greeting in her life."
    gi "Hello, dear dreamer."
    narrator2 "However, the doll could only stare in silence, for it did not know of words."
    narrator2 "So the girl smiled— deeply and widely from the bottom of her heart."
    narrator2 "For even if the doll did not know of words, it should know of smiles."
    narrator2 "That was what the girl thought, or rather, wished for."
    gi "You must have so many questions."
    gi "So let me show you. Your naught and nil. My all fulfilled."
    narrator2 "Taking the doll’s hand in hers, the girl turned to the water’s surface where two reflections rippled like the turning of a tale’s pages, the jostling of an upended bookmark."

    gi "The puppet, the puppeteer, no more.{p=0.5}I am you, and you are me."

    gi "This beautiful world I’ve always longed to share with someone…"
    gi "Won’t you come and play with me?"
    narrator2 "The world had not changed by the doll entering it."

    do "Will you show me unfun things as well?"
    gi "Of course. It’s important to experience all the colors of life."
    gi "Even sadness is a necessary sweet pain. Because it lets you know what happiness is."
    do "It’s not enough to just be happy?"
    gi "Even if one knows the utmost of happiness, it is but a hollow construct in a vacuum if not complemented or contrasted by the other colors of life."

    narrator2 "The girl giggled when the doll nodded in understanding."
    narrator2 "Though she was playful like this, she was very wise. There was never a moment when the doll was not learning something from her."
    gi "Listen well, dear dreamer."
    gi "A monochrome happiness has no value. Pleasant tints, painful shades, and tones that meld the two together— they’re all treasures."
    gi "It is for that reason that you are adorned in seven colors."
    narrator2 "Even things that are painful and sad should be wished for."
    narrator2 "That was what the girl said."

    narrator2 "It was now dyed a cold and distant shade."
    gi "Did you know, dear dreamer?"
    gi "No matter how much I wish to, I can’t create a story."

    gi "A writer can pen enough books to circle the horizon, but without a reader a story can never be born of it."
    gi "Without a reader, a book is nothing but a one-sided coin."

    narrator2 "Sinking to her knees, the girl cradled the arm lying on the ground."
    narrator2 "Her hunched figure seemed incredibly small to the doll."
    gi "Most of my body has already been replaced with doll parts."
    gi "I am almost as much doll as you."
    narrator2 "The girl had spared nothing, not even her own body in her yearning to create another ‘self.’"
    gi "It is for that reason that I know."

    gi "Dolls like you don’t have any will of their own…{p=0.5}They are simply being inhabited by mine."

    gi "You are incapable of disobeying the script I write for you."
    gi "But most importantly…"
    gi "You are incapable of writing your own script."
    narrator2 "The doll did not know what to say. It did not know how to feel."
    narrator2 "Perhaps it was shock."
    narrator2 "Or perhaps… it was because the girl had not yet determined what the doll might feel or say."
    gi "You understand now don’t you? Why you can’t create a world with me…"

    na2 "Yes. Socotrine had long been aware of the existence of the unknown lands from artifacts that washed up on Evighet’s northern banks."
    na2 "However, 195 marked the first time that actual people came from beyond the mist."
    na2 "In 195 a convoy of people describing themselves as \"refugees from a devastated land\" sailed down the river Evighet and made contact with Socotrine for the first time."
    na2 "Though the old aristocracy welcomed the refugees at first, they eventually began to suspect that the convoy would attempt a coup."

    narrator2 "Then, one fateful day, a mother whose son was on the verge of death finally encountered the goddess of legend."

    narrator2 "However; when the girl saw the boy’s wasted body, she was overcome with great sorrow."
    narrator2 "He was suffering, and in great pain."
    narrator2 "And so, wishing that the boy wouldn’t die, the girl leaned over him and began to cry."
    narrator2 "Big beautiful tears began to drip from the girl’s eyes in unbelievable amounts, trickling through the boy’s parched lips."
    narrator2 "Letting him drink tears as clear and pure as the rain that once fell upon the land, the girl pulled the boy back from the boundary of life and death."
    narrator2 "The smile of a young girl whose face was still wet with tears— that was the sight the boy opened his eyes to upon being saved from certain death."
    narrator2 "Meanwhile, having witnessed a miracle, the mother cried out in gratitude and implored the girl to come back to the village so that she might help others in need."

    narrator2 "Her first exposure to the outside world deeply affected her."

    narrator2 "In their desperation to survive, the villagers were forced to break an unspeakable taboo."

    narrator2 "Those that were unable to defend themselves were the first to go."

    narrator2 "Neighbors that had stuck with each other through thick and thin began to turn on one another, painting the landscape sickening shades of scarlet."
    narrator2 "Those scarlet visions tormented the girl, bringing her such anguish that blood flowed from her eyes as she wept before the village’s withered fields."
    narrator2 "It was then that, from the crimson tears that touched the cracked soil, florae began to spring up wondrously from the earth."

    narrator2 "Upon witnessing this miracle, the villagers tried to use the girl’s power to nourish their fields."
    narrator2 "But though the girl wept torrents throughout the day and night at the villager’s plight, it was never the tears of blood that they needed."
    narrator2 "It was in that hopeless situation that the villagers came to a terrible conclusion—{p=0.25}if the girl would not cry tears of blood…{w=0.5} they would have to take it from her."
    narrator2 "The only way to garner the blood they needed was by cutting into her body and draining it."
    narrator2 "A stone shrine atop a hill overlooking the village.{p=0.25}The people locked the girl up there, driving her to a state of perpetual near death as they extracted her blood over and over again."
    narrator2 "‘It’s the only way we can survive’ was how they rationalized it."
    narrator2 "Whenever it seemed like the girl was becoming numb and crying less as a result, the villagers had no choice but to devise crueler ways to hurt her."
    narrator2 "It was a wretched state of existence in which they could only subsist if the girl’s blood and tears flowed freely."
    narrator2 "But even then, the girl never forsook the villagers."
    narrator2 "With a smile that grew weaker by the day she continued to cry, thinking only of their sake."
    narrator2 "However, her smile did not ease the villagers’ hearts."

    narrator2 "At long last, the people had regained a semblance of the peaceful days they once knew."
    narrator2 "But there were those who could not accept it."
    narrator2 "Back in the house the girl had called home since coming to the village…\nThe young boy whose life had been saved in the forest asked of his mother:"

    am "And so they decided to send a messenger to the heavens to ask for guidance."
    am "The Rainbow Crow, a bird with big, beautiful feathers that shone like prisms, offered to make the long journey."
    am "It braved the cold, harsh winds of winter until it reached the heavens, where it was rewarded with the gift of fire."
    am "But when it returned to the village with the gift, it was no longer the same."
    am "The fire had scorched its beautiful feathers away so that it could no longer fly, and the smoke had stripped it of its voice."
    am "The Rainbow Crow was no longer beautiful, and could no longer sing."
    am "But the people did not care."
    am "They honored the Rainbow Crow’s noble sacrifice, for the fire it brought home allowed them to weather the cold winter."

    narrator2 "Mother seemed conflicted, but eventually she acquiesces."
    am "The truth is…{w=0.4} the Rainbow Crow had a child."
    am "A child with beautiful rainbow feathers and a lovely singing voice, just like the Rainbow Crow once had."
    am "However, when the young Rainbow Crow was but a chick, a villager dropped it by accident."
    am "The young Rainbow Crow became terrified of human beings and could not live in the village."
    am "Instead it lived alone in a nearby forest."
    am "While unable to join in itself, the Rainbow Crow would often visit to listen to its child’s innocent song."
    am "So even though the young Rainbow Crow became lonely at times, it was still happy."
    am "One day, a poor abandoned child wandered into the depths of the forest and heard the young Rainbow Crow’s song."
    am "Even though the bird was scared of human beings, it took pity on the starving child."
    am "So it pecked off one of its beautiful, priceless feathers and gave it to the child."
    am "The child brought it back to the family that had abandoned him."
    am "Pleased, they let him live with them again."
    am "However; upon hearing of the story, countless people rushed into the forest one after another, each telling the young Rainbow Crow of how poor and unfortunate they were."
    am "The bird’s heart went out for them, and it gave them one shining feather after another until its body was reduced to a sorry state."
    am "Without any feathers, the young Rainbow Crow could no longer fly and find food."

    am "Then winter came."
    am "The cold and hunger caused even its beautiful voice to become rough and hoarse."
    am "It was as it shivered in the snow that the child from before appeared in front of it."
    am "The child told it that he was searching for a beautiful bird with a lovely singing voice in order to repay his debts."
    am "The young Rainbow Crow was overjoyed."
    am "“That was me.” It croaked."
    am "“Please, would you not keep me warm in your chest?”"
    am "But the child took one glance at the ugly, featherless bird and called it a liar."
    am "Cutting down the bird, the child cooked it over a fire and ate it before continuing on with his quest."
    am "It was at that time that the Rainbow Crow caught word of beautiful rainbow feathers being sold throughout the village."
    am "With worry in its heart, the Rainbow Crow ventured into the forest."
    am "However, the only thing that awaited it…"
    am "…Was the charred bones of its beloved child."
    am "The Rainbow Crow could not forgive what the villagers had done to its dear child."
    am "In rage and grief, the Rainbow Crow swallowed the gift of fire from the heavens."
    am "Its body became wreathed in flames, setting the village on fire."
    am "But even after the village turned to ash, the Rainbow Crow did not stop burning."
    am "For the gift of fire was eternal, and could not be extinguished."
    am "To this day, the Rainbow Crow wanders the earth, burning everything in its path as it cries out for its lost child..."
